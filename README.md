# Minecraft-Liquid-Enchanting
Source code for my Minecraft mod "Liquid Enchanting". This allows you to combine armors and swords with potions in a crafting table, and get that potion effect whenever the armor is worn.
This code is free for anyone to download, learn from or fork to develop your own mods! If releasing as a new mod, or using parts of this code, please credit Cookiehook and the version you forked from in your release.

## How to Use
1. Select the branch you want to download from the top left **Branch:** menu. All branches named MC-### are functional code for that version of Minecraft.
2. Click the **Clone or Download** button to get a copy of the code. If you're not sure what this "git" thingummy is, click **download as Zip**.
3. Unzip the file, open a CMD window in that directory and run:
```
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
gradlew eclipse
```
4. The project is now ready to run. Open eclipse and import the project.
